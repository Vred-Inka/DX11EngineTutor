Use the convention `lower-case-with-hyphens-model-name.{png,zip,obj}`. For example, `stanford-bunny.png` is a **256px**-wide image of the model, `stanford-bunny.zip` contains the "original data" (in whatever format that contains therein), and `stanford-bunny.obj` contains an "high-resolution" (minimum of full resolution or 100K elements) [.obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) file.
